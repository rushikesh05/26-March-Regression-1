For instance, let's say we want to predict the weight of a person based on their height. Here, height is the independent variable, and weight is the dependent variable. We can use a linear equation to model the relationship between the two variables. The equation will look something like this:\n",

        "* Linearity: The relationship between the independent and dependent variables should be linear. This means that the effect of a one-unit change in the independent variable on the dependent variable is constant. We can check this assumption by plotting a scatterplot of the independent variable against the dependent variable and looking for a linear relationship.\n",

        "* Independence: The observations should be independent of each other. This means that the value of the dependent variable for one observation should not be related to the value of the dependent variable for another observation. We can check this assumption by ensuring that there is no systematic pattern in the residuals (the difference between the observed value and the predicted value) when plotted against the independent variable or the time of observation.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Normality: The residuals should be normally distributed. This means that the distribution of the residuals should be symmetric and bell-shaped. We can check this assumption by plotting a histogram or a Q-Q plot of the residuals and looking for a normal distribution.\n",
        "\n",
        "* No multicollinearity: In multiple linear regression, the independent variables should not be highly correlated with each other. We can check this assumption by calculating the correlation matrix between the independent variables and looking for high correlations.\n",

Stochastic gradient descent is often used in large-scale machine learning problems, as it is more computationally efficient than batch gradient descent.\n",
